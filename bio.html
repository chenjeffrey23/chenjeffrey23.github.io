<h1>About Me</h1>

<main id = "bio">

<p id >Hello! I am a 4th year Informatics Major with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction at the University of California, Irvine. I am originally from San Francisco. I have learned many different skills here at UCI including programming and software design skills. I am currently interested in learning more about web development.</p>
