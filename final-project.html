User Interviews</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/UserInterviews.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen User Interviews" ></div>
<p class="content">
User interviews are important because it gives insight on what others who are making a similar product prioritize or what a viewer of your product would want to see. The types of questions asked in my user interviews included questions about the interviewee's background and their thoughts on what a portfolio should include and what a successful portfolio achieves. I had the chance to interview three different perspectives, a student from another college, a recent graduate and the professor for this course. Each interviewee gave a nuanced view of what should be found in the portfolio, but the similarity between the interviews was that there should be examples of the person's work and the goal should be to convey relevant information to the viewer. The answer that stood out the most to me was that the portfolio should frame your experiences well and give a sense of who you are as a person since it will most likely be the first impression a hiring manager will have of you.

	Competitor Analysis
</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/CompetitorAnalysis.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen User Competitor Analysis" ></div>
<p class="content">
Competitor analysis is used to analyze what others in the field are doing in regards to their similar projects to gain insight on how to improve your own. For this portion I chose two student portfolios and two professional portfolios. I chose this split because I wanted to get ideas from people in a similar position to me as well as those who already have substantial experience. This allows for a wide range of ideas and different perspectives for me to analyze. The two students are friends, and the two professionals I found from an article about great UX designer portfolios. The main takeaway from the analysis was that each portfolio gave a different sense of the person that was seen in the aesthetic of the website and what was chosen to be shown. A feature I really liked was the process portion that the professionals included which highlighted the importance of showing the process that goes into the final products in addition to the final products to give a better idea of the capabilities of the designer and the effort that went into the product.

	Feature Value Matrix
</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/FeatureValueMatrix.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen Feature Value Matrix" ></div>
<p class="content">
The feature value matrix is used to give a quantifiable value to a feature based on its user value, business value and developmental effort. The matrix gives the developer a better idea about which features should be focused on by giving it a clear score that can be compared to scores of other features. After the user interviews and competitor analysis, I came to the conclusion that these features were necessary for a successful portfolio and I do not think any of them are unattainable. These features were seen on the professional portfolios I analyzed and I believe they were achievable even if the execution would not be as impressive. As I learn more about web development and the industry, the numbers associated to each metric might change, but with my current knowledge and experience I believe that these are common features that a portfolio should have.

	Feature Prioritization
</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/FeaturePrioritization.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen Feature Prioritization"></div>
<p class="content">
Feature prioritization is how a developer should prioritize which features to implement first. My feature prioritization is based off of my feature value matrix. The lower the total score, the higher I prioritized that feature. I believe this is a great way to budget time and effort because it is not wise to spend a lot of effort on a feature that will have less value overall than another feature that had higher value that could have been implemented with much shorter time. This is especially important if you have a strict deadline where there is a chance you might not be able to implement all your features. For this reason I prioritized important features that had high user and business value, but low developmental effort knowing that I could finish those quickly and then focus on more difficult to implement features. This will be a very useful guideline once I decide to improve my portfolio.

	User Stories
</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/UserStories.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen User Stories"></div>
<p class="content">
User stories are used to see how a user would achieve their goal when using your product. I created these user stories by picking a type of user and thinking about what they would want to look for on my website and how they would achieve that goal. Because this is a portfolio with the purpose of finding a job, the user that was most common for these user stories was a hiring manager and how they would look for relevant information regarding my capabilities and how to contact me if they had any inquiries regarding those capabilities. These user stories allowed me to focus on how to make the process simple and intuitive for the user to achive these goals.

Cognitive Walkthroughs
</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/CognitiveWalkthrough.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen Cognitive Walkthroughs"></div>
<p class="content">
Cognitive walkthroughs are used to see how learnable an interface is for new or infrequent viewers. The goal of these walkthroughs is to see how the user responds to your tasks and record any issues of difficulties your user might have when trying to achieve these tasks. Overall, the cognitive walkthroughs went smoothly for me. Each user was able to do everything I asked well and was thoroughly pleased with the portfolio. In hindsight, I realize that I might not have given the user enough freedom when using the website and assigned tasks that did not encourage them to explore or utilize the entire website. In the future, I will keep this in mind when utilizing cognitive walkthroughs.

User Tests
</p>
<div><img class = "finalpic" img src="img/ClickTest.png" alt="Jeffrey Chen User Test"></div>
<p class="content">
The user tests I conducted were a click test and a three question test. I chose them because I wanted to test how intuitive my interface was and I walked to get the user's opinion regarding a feature I planned to implement. Overall, both tests were very successful and I got the answers I expected. The click test showed that it was very clear where to go if you wanted to find a certain feature of my website. The question test reaffirmed the necessity of social media buttons and I also got user input on what social media buttons I should include. The challenges I faced regarding this was how difficult it was to find people willing to test the interface and hoping that the person takes the test seriously. I still gained valuable insight from these tests and will have less problems with these challenges in the future.

Summary of Findings
</p>
<p class="content">
After completing this project, I have found that there were a few important aspects that my website lacked that were found in many other websites. These features included a portfolio section, a process section and social media buttons. I have also seen different ways to implement these features that gives me inspiration to find my own style and the message that I want to convey through my portfolio. My current goal for my portfolio is that it should be an accurate representation of who I am. My personality should shine clearly through my portfolio and although I believe that aspects of who I am are shown in my current portfolio, I have a long way to go before it becomes a clearer representation.
</p>
<p class="content">
Although I have used some of these techniques in the past and have known of them for a long time, this was the first time that I had to conduct them by myself for something I actually created. It made me realize how useful these techniques are. I learned many different things about how to better my portfolio throughout this process. I used to think that some of these techniques could be skipped over due to lack of time and the effort required to use them, but I realize now that the value greatly outweighs the cost. Even though going forward I am not sure if I will use every single technique used in this project for my future projects, I will definitely use them when necessary and when time permits because the insight they provide will definitely lead to a more successful product.

Incorporation of Findings
</p>
<p class="content">
The first change I would like to make is to add the features that I plan to add which include replacing the contact email with a contact form, adding social media buttons and adding a portfolio and process section. These changes will take time to perfect, but adding them initially will be quite simple. I would also want to upgrade my existing features with how I wanted to do them if I had more time. An example of this is replacing the picture of the resume with a pdf viewer and adding a download link to the resume. After adding all these features and changing the current features, I would need to update them as I get more experience and inspiration for new ideas.
</p>
<p class="content">
After adding all the new features, I would want to focus on content and how to frame my portfolio in a way that shows who I am as a person clearly. This part is going to be difficult because I find it hard to think about how to approach this problem. This is something that I will probably never be able to perfect, but will be able to get closer and closer to the more effort I put in. This aspect is important because I believe it would be a great opportunity for me to stand out amongst others applying to the same job. There are so many ways that I can begin to go about this, but I believe I want to start with the content and what I decide to include in my about me, portfolio and process sections. In the future when I have more experience with javascript and html/css, I wish to express who I am with the style of the website as well.
